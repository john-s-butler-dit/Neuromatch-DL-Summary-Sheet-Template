Now itâ€™s time for you to create your first neural network using PyTorch. This section will walk you through the process of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
Creating a simple neural network model
    \item Training the network
    \item Visualizing the results of the network
    \item Tweaking the network
\end{itemize}

\begin{subbox}{subbox}{ Data }

First we need some sample data to train our network on. The example dataset consists of 2D points along two interleaving half circles, figure below.
